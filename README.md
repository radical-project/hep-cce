HEP-CCE (High Energy Physics Center for Computational Excellence)
===
The HEP-CCE is a cross-cutting initiative to promote excellence in high 
performance computing (HPC) including data-intensive applications, scientific 
simulations, and data movement and storage. Enhancing connections with DOE's 
Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) program is an important part of 
the Center's activities. This includes promoting future-looking R&D initiatives 
in exascale architectures and systems, intelligent networking, and new data 
management and data analysis tools.
