**RADICAL-Cybertools (RCT) deployment**

Supercomputer Theta at ALCF (Argonne Leadership Computing Facility) with a peak 
performance of 11.69-petaFLOPS was provided to conduct experiments using RCT 
stack. RCT stack relies on a set of technology solutions provided below and for 
which installation and adjustment processes were made as the first stage of 
commissioning.

- Communication layer to pass tasks for the execution to the compute nodes - 
MongoDB. RCT stack (of a current version 1.5) requires to have a connection to 
or a local installation of MongoDB. ALCF Theta allows to have MongoDB running on
a login node ([guide](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/support-center/theta/mongodb)). 
Corresponding user guide for RCT stack was created and the whole process of 
MongoDB installation and using was tested.
- Task placement for the execution relies on Resource Manager and Launch Method 
(in terms of RADICAL-Pilot, a core component of RCT stack), which are 
represented by `Cobalt` (the queuing system used at ALCF, [Cobalt HPC Job 
Scheduler](https://xgitlab.cels.anl.gov/aig-public/cobalt)) and `aprun` (to [run
script](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/support-center/theta/running-jobs-and-submission-scripts),
which is given to Cobalt, on KNL nodes) respectively. Corresponding modules that 
were developed earlier (`radical.pilot.agent.resource_manager.cobalt` and 
`radical.pilot.agent.launch_method.aprun`) were adjusted and tested.
- Test run of a simple script job 
[hello_rp.sh](https://github.com/radical-cybertools/radical.pilot/blob/master/examples/hello_rp.sh) 
was successful.
